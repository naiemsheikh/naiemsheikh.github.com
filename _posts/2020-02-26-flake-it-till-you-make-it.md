Which developer don't know Jquery? I think none. this type of libraries are good for quick work. But it's a bad habit for long term career, otherside Plain JS or Vanilla JS is the pure form of JS. Now a days most of the JS frameworks are in Vanilla JS syntex. Such as ReactJS.

# What is Vanilla JavaScript or Plain JavaScript:
The Purest JavaScript form is referred to be called Vanilla Script. Vanilla scripts start working when you need to write a script without a library. There are indications in the name. The definition of the word "vanilla" describes it as something that has "no special or additional properties." order in words, natural or standard. VanillaJS is a spoof framework. It’s basically a joke / satire. If you configure the various options and download the vanilla.js file, you will find that it is completely empty. Regardless of which features you selected.

# Why should you learn vanilla JavaScript before frameworks?
If you master JavaScript fundamentals, your only challenge when learning new JS frameworks will be scoped to their specific syntax.

JavaScript is now the programming language for the web. Therefore, understanding its core engineering principles is paramount if you want to build yourself a decent web career, especially if you're aiming for the front of the pack.

In the past 5 years, more than 10 frontend JS frameworks made the news. Guess how many will do the same in the next 5-10 years? If you're merely pretending to know JavaScript, the engine powering this web revolution, how will you keep up?

Just think about what "jQuery developers" had to do: trying to catch up on Angular. Now, they're trying to catch up on React/Vue. Who knows what it will be tomorrow? And the sad, depressing loop goes on.

# Conclusion
If you don't know the underlying principles of the web, you'll eventually hit a wall thanks to the evolution of the language itself and the constant arrival of new frameworks.

Knowing pure JS will make you a key engineer who can solve complex problems (reason before frantic searching).

It'll make you versatile and productive, both on the front-end and back-end.

It'll give you the toolset to innovate, not just execute.

It’ll guide you on when to use a framework or not.

It'll give you a better general understanding of how browsers and computers work.

Using a JS framework can surely bring you somewhere fast. But it won't bring you far if you don't understand the core concepts behind it. Just like learning to play Wonderwall on the guitar won’t teach you how to compose music, it’ll give you a reason to practice.

I firmly believe that this "learn the basics/roots first" principle applies to pretty much everything in life. From learning a new programming language to starting a new sport. It requires a lot of practice, but once you master it, the only thing left to do is to get creative with it. And that's where the real fun begins.
